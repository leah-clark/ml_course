    "# Introduction to Machine Learning\n",

    "## Week 0 - Overview\n",
    "### What's this all about?\n",
    "We ( @leah and @ollie on Slack) wanted to put together a simple introductory course to machine learning. We're hoping that it will be a relatively easy to follow introduction. One thing to understand is that machine learning isn't about the buzzwords and the fact that it's pretty sexy at the moment. Machine learning at it's heart is a process. A pretty awesome process that's a lot of fun, but underneath it all, there's a common process that should be followed, all with one goal, generalisation. Over this notebook, we intend to outline the process and define what we mean by generalisation. Throughout the next few notebooks, we will go into each step a little further. We hope that this will be an interactive learing process and we encourage questions. We're available on the slack channel #ssaeas-machine-learn or #machine_learning. There's no such thing as a stupid question, and if you have any questions, please ask them. We will have skipped over a lot of details, so there's a lot of things that you could ask about. If you're thinking it, there's probably others thinking it too. We'll try to integrate answers back into these notebooks so that they become living documents.\n",

    "### Introduction\n",
    "When people talk about machine learning, they can be talking about a lot of things. Generally machine learning is a subset of AI. In turn, deep learning is a subset of machine learning. FYI, we're planning on getting to deep learning in weeks 2&3.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, machine learning is a process. It's important that this is understood so that any implementation doesn't become [a high interest credit card of technical debt](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/43146.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generalisation\n",
    "This is the fundamental goal of machine learning. We don't want to teach a model to behave perfectly on data that it's already seen. If we wanted that, we might as well just build a database. Instead, we want a model that learns *from* some data, finding some rules that apply equally well to data that it's not seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The process\n",
    "As stated, machine learning is a process, with the goal being generalisation. The process that you will (**should**) see in any machine learning approach to solving is problem is..\n",
    "Gather the data -> understand the data -> pre-processing -> training a model -> post-processing (optional) -> model evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gather the data\n",
    "First, we need to have data. You could get this from scraping websites (for example with [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#)), you could so surveys or whatever data collection method you like. However, usually this gets saved into a .csv (comma separated value) file.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a really useful tool for this. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's tackle a simple problem. We'll try to predict [if a game of tic-tac-toe is winnable](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Tic-Tac-Toe+Endgame).\n",
    "\n",
    "First let's import the data, which is conveniently held in tic-tac-toe.csv"

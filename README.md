# ml_course
Hopefully this course will be a help to those new to machine learning.

We ( @ollie and @Leah on Slack ) have written / are writing these ‘lessons’ using Jupyter notebooks. They’re a really cool way to both write down what we want to say, but also give code examples.

## To get jupyter notebooks running
1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
2. Launch anaconda-navigator
3. Launch jupyterlab
4. Navigate to the ml_course directory and open Wk0.ipynb
